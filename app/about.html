      <h2>About Quadra</h2>
      <div class="br"></div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Quadra was a dream born after reading the 7 habits of highly effective
          teens by Sean Covey. In his chapter 3 he explained a time management
          technique that involved listing and prioritizing your tasks so as to
          be able to quickly complete the most important things in your life.
          Its essentially living life according to what matters most.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have adapted the quadrants to be able to suit your
          "comparing"/"prioritizing" needs as you can now change what each
          quadrant means to you. A good example is changing the quadrant to
          reflect the four panes of the Johari window so as to become a better
          leader or person. Hopefully Quadra helps you along in that journey.
        </p>

          Whats more? You can save your quadrants allowing you to manage
          multiple quadrants to better increase your productivity. I'd love to
          hear your feedback and what you think could be added to improve the
          way Quadra can serve you better. You can reach out
