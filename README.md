# Quadra

This is an Electron application that helps you in prioritizing your time by dividing your tasks into quadrants. The app was built using a modified materialize css for the frontend and ElectronJS on the backend.

## About Quadra

Quadra was a dream born after reading the 7 habits of highly effective teens by Sean Covey. In his chapter 3 he explained a time management technique that involved listing and prioritizing your tasks so as to be able to quickly complete the most important things in your life. Its essentially living life according to what matters most.

I have adapted the quadrants to be able to suit your "comparing"/"prioritizing" needs as you can now change what each quadrant means to you. A good example is changing the quadrant to reflect the four panes of the Johari window so as to become a better leader or person. Hopefully Quadra helps you along in that journey.

Whats more? You can save your quadrants allowing you to manage multiple quadrants to better increase your productivity. I'd love to hear your feedback and what you think could be added to improve the way Quadra can serve you better. You can reach out below.
